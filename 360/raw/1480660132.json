	"description": "Mighty No. 9 is a Japanese 2D side-scrolling action game that takes the best elements from 8 & 16-bit classics that you know and love and transforms them with modern tech, fresh mechanics, and fan input into something amazing!  Led by Keiji Inafune & a veteran team with decades of experience, Mighty No. 9 promises to be an evolution in the genre!  You play as Beck, the 9th in a line of powerful robots, and the only one not infected by a mysterious computer virus that has caused mechanized creatures the world over to go berserk. Run, jump, blast, and transform your way through twelve stages using weapons and abilities stolen from your enemies to take down your fellow Mighty Number robots and confront the final evil that threatens the planet!  Key Features: Classic 2D Action Transformed - Face off against your eight Mighty brethren in 12 challenging stages and unlock new transformations as you defeat them, granting unique skills and abilities  Additional Single Player Modes to Test Your Skills - Fight each boss in back-to-back battles against a ticking clock, master over a dozen mini-missions & challenges, and unlock two additional difficulty modes in a New Game+ for an even Mightier challenge!  Two-Player Mechanical Mayhem - Take on missions online with a friend, playing as Beck and his partner, Call; Use their unique powers to overcome obstacles as a team, or go head-to-head in an Online Race Battle to see who can get through a stage the fastest  Show the world how Mighty you are - Use Beck's Absorption Dash skill and his other abilities & transformations to chain together combos and perfect your run-throughs to earn those sweet S-Ranks, high scores, and leaderboard rankings!  Chip Tune FTW!: we all know there's nothing quite like the 8-bit classic game tunes of old, so Mighty No. 9 features an optional chiptune version of the entire game soundtrack which you can toggle on and off!",
