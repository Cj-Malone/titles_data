If you really think that you have what it takes to get Spidy from A to B then be our guest…  Determination is what you will need when you are dropped straight into an underwater cave! No wait, determination and a lot of speedy quick reflexes, because without these there is certainly no way you can beat this level. Challenge accepted?  Until now Spidy has never felt so helpless. You have to guide him out of the deepest and darkest depths of the caves; there is no sign of life anywhere! Don’t be miss lead, there is still plenty of danger this far into the earth’s crust, as you are in far less control due to wind tunnels, floating spores and unstable stalactites.  You’ll be more than happy to reach the end, if you can?! ",
