As Major John “Dutch” Cane, you're in charge of a platoon of mercenary commandos—mercenaries outfitted with experimental weaponry the military wouldn't even dream of issuing to their troops. Officially, these guys don't even exist. Lead your team into a space station that has been overrun by mutated alien parasites. Your orders are to take out the enemy before they have a chance to zero in on the station's control center and threaten colonized space.
