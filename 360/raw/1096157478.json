Creating a fantastic but compelling world true to the spirit of King’s Quest required going back to the lessons of old. Beginning with 1990’s King’s Quest V, Sierra devised a way for its artists to draw out their ideas in vivid color and detail before scanning them into the game for further polishing. Now, 25 years later, the team is employing a similar technique to give this incredible reimagining of a classic tale the truly stunning storybook look it deserves.",
