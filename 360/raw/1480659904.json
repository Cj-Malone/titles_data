			"description": "Today, we are taking you for a trip far away from Earth, over 200 million miles from here. The new role-playing game from Spiders Studio, Mars War Logs, shows a new side of itself through a splendid new video exclusively made of in-game footage. Guaranteed 100% Dubstep-free, this first trailer is supported by bewitching music that contrasts with the strong images of the video: the survivors of the great cataclysm that hit Mars, who have retreated into huge slum-cities and are subjected to the dictatorship of the guilds controlling the planet's most precious resource, water.   Mars' first trailer presents the cyberpunk universe, where the technology and violence of a decadent world clash with supernatural creatures, mystical characters and out-of-the-ordinary powers. ",

Narrated by Jehanne Rousseau, CEO of Spiders, this 2m40s video shows new gameplay sequences and tells us more about the game and its origins. We learn how Mars War Logs was born and how its talented and passionate developers gave a truly unique soul to this project.  After giving us details about the setting of this game that presents the Red Planet as we have never seen it before, we learn why Mars War Logs is a fully-fledged RPG, in which player choices leave their mark on the story and its unfolding. Spiders Studio really wanted to offer total freedom to the players who will have to face the consequences of their decisions through dialogues, through choosing their skills, with their behaviour toward their companions, or even through the equipment and upgrades they decide to craft. Players will even be forced to take responsibility for their actions!",
