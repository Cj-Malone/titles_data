Take on the role of alien Cryptosporidium 137 and terrorize the people of Earth to harvest their DNA in the most brazen action-adventure you've ever played. Take over all of humanity using a variety of alien weaponry on land or in the air.  Take over all of humanity using a variety of alien weaponry such as a ray gun, an anal probe gun, the Ion Detonator, the Zap-O-Matic, the Sonic Boom, the Quantum Deconstructor, a powerful nuclear weapon that can launch radioactive bombs, and more – on land or in the air.   Crypto can use Telekinesis to throw cars, trucks and cows to create even more of a turmoil or disguise himself as a puny human.   For transport, use a jet pack for short distances or your UFO for travelling long distances and abducting or destroying humans.   Take one giant step on mankind!",
