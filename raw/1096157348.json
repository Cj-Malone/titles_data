            "description": "SIDESWIPE lives to fight, and while he generally prefers his swords, recently, IRONHIDE has convinced him to give blasters another chance. He hunts the DECEPTICONS around the world, destroying them wherever he can find them. With his blades extended and his wheels on the ground, no one can stop him!  SIDESWIPE is an original AUTOBOT, one with a long legacy in the Transformers universe.  With a role in Revenge of the Fallen, he showcased his melee skills and agility.  In the Dark of The Moon game, he is now armed with a Scoped Burst Rifle for ranged combat as well as his powerful Cybertanium arm blades that allow for a powerful whirlwind attack.  He compliments the other AUTOBOT Scouts as MIRAGE and BUMBLEBEE are geared towards short and mid-range combat whereas SIDESWIPE can be dangerous from any range.  SIDESWIPE is a scout character, quick on his feet (wheels) and ready to mix it up with DECEPTICONS.  He excels at hit and run tactics, and can effortlessly move in and out of fights in both robot and vehicle form.  Gamers who prefer speed and melee capabilities should look to SIDESWIPE as a class-A specimen.",
