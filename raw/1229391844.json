Here, the difference between winning and disaster is measured in inches: get a little bit off line and you will be pin-balling along the guardrails in the Parc Beaumont. The typical crested tarmac of the Pau streets can be a real obstacle and run you off the road. To minimize this effect, set the car up with plenty of suspension travel.",

However, the original track closed in 1960 due to the high risk of accidents. The circuit as we know it today was revived in 2005.  A few minor adjustments were made compared to the original track, notably some additional kilometres added to the length, now 5.333km.",
