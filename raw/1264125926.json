DARK is a unique stealth-action game with RPG elements in which you take on the role of the ultimate hunter: a vampire.

Features: • Stealth and action meet role-playing: earn experience, pick your dialogue choices and develop your skills to become the ultimate hunter • Use impressive vampire skills and powerful melee attacks to eliminate your foes from the cover of darkness – go invisible, stalk your prey unnoticed and devastate them with up-close attacks • A variety of enemies await your fangs – from mortal human police and security guards to fellow creatures of the night • Make your way through lavishly appointed environments, from the city museum to the hidden fortress of a vampire lord hidden within a towering skyscraper • Impressive 3D cel-shaded graphics ",
