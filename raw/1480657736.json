In the ‘50s Rock’n’Roll music was spawned straight from hell and was so evil that it turned dead people into Zombies! Three survivors - Jack Foster, a construction worker, Foxy Jones, a traffic warden, and Mike Bacon, a perpetually hungry boy scout - have formed an unlikely alliance to protect themselves from the invading undead. Hiding in abandoned buildings, they build blockades, set traps and – as a last resort – use weapons to fight the Zombies.
