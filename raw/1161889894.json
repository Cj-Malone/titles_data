    "description": "The multiplayer functionality of this title is no longer available.  You will only have access to the single player aspects of the game after download  On the eve of the Cuban revolution, a major mob meeting in Havana takes a bloody turn. The Don of your family is killed, and you must take the reins and lead your battered organization. Success breeds opportunity, so when Michael Corleone comes under investigation by a Senate Committee on Organized Crime, the Corleone Family calls upon you to reestablish its operation in New York and expand into a new territory - Miami. Build up your arsenal, build alliances, and make whatever deals you need to as you fight off attacks and strike back at your rivals. There'll be a price on your head and a target on your back, but don't take it personally. After all, it's only business.",
